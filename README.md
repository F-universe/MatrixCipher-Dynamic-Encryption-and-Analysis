This project aims to create a secure key for encrypting and decrypting files. 
Here's how the key is generated:

When you run the app.py code, it starts a Flask application where the user can input any word.
Upon clicking "Search," a Selenium WebDriver fetches the corresponding Wikipedia page for that word. 
The letters from the page are then displayed in a 64x64 matrix.

Next, a second matrix is generated, this time populated with custom PNG images created by me. 
These images are placed in the matrix according to specific criteria. For example, if two consecutive
consonants appear in the first matrix, the image 1.png will be displayed in the corresponding cell of 
the second matrix.

Finally, a numerical key is created. Each row of this key represents the sum of the colored pixels of
the images found in the corresponding row of the second matrix. This numerical key is then saved and 
used to encrypt and decrypt messages using the crypting.py and decrypting.py scripts.

The files crypting.py and decrypting.py are located in the folder named crypted. These scripts are responsible for managing the encryption and decryption of messages using the numerical key generated by the project.

The matrix.html file, which provides the template for the Flask application interface, is located in the templates folder. This is where the 64x64 matrices and the associated functionality are rendered for the user.

The style.css file, which defines the design and styling of the application, is located in the css folder within the crypto directory. Additionally, all custom PNG images used in the second matrix, such as 1.png, 2.png, and others, are also stored inside the crypto directory.
